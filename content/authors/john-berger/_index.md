## 

Dr. John Berger is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines and a Principal Investigator in the Chemo-Mechanical Research Group. His research focuses on the mechanical behavior and fracture of materials, with contributions spanning dynamic crack growth, anisotropic solids, functionally graded materials, and chemo-elastic mechanics in electrochemical energy systems, including lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells. He also leads strategic initiatives in energy and materials at Mines.
