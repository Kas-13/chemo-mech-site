Rob graduated with a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Mines in 2017.  He assisted with new device production procedures and helped with new device design while working at a pain therapy infusion device company. Rob returned to graduate school in 2019 to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. Rob first researched the corrosion of additively manufactured metal alloys, focusing on the effects of microstructure and electrochemical bias on the removal of 3D printed supports. His current research focuses on the electro-chemomechanical behavior of all-solid-state batteries and studying the effects of material anisotropy on electrode properties and cell performance. In his free time, Rob is an avid practitioner of mixed martial arts.
