## Research Overview

Peter completed both his BS and MS at Mines, with a minor in aerospace and a strong interest in computational and applied mathematics.

His research focuses on electro-chemo-mechanical modeling of electrochemical systems—particularly all-solid-state batteries—using finite-element and phase-field methods.
